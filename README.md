i wanted to learn how to make a portable kernel **correctly**, and I decided to create this
project to do so

its not complete, I also decided to go with a different programming style this time around
:-)

I currently just have an aarch64-virt target, a stub target and a rp4 target, but I am planning to make the rp4 target functional (it kind of works now but theres a ton of stubs) (x86_64 im not planning to touch until this kernel gets into a functional usermode)
