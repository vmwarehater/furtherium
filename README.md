# Futherium


i wanted to learn how to make a portable kernel **correctly**, and I decided to create this
project to do so

its not complete, I also decided to go with a different programming style this time around
:-)

I currently just have an aarch64-virt target and a stub target, but I am planning to also add a riscv64 target also (x86_64 im not planning to touch until this kernel gets into a functional usermode)
